This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project, I tries to draw a path or shapes depending on the clicks in the canvas area. Hereby, the shapes are created dynamically with just random clicks. Finally, a movement or simulation on those paths are illustrated...

Motive: 
1- Learn and get my hands dirty on canvas.
2- Moving to be better.
